    # SORT METHODS
    # alphabetical
    # The display order of results is determined by the string contained in fieldName. Results are displayed in alphabetical order.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a SortType field.

    # decreasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number or string contained in fieldName. The result with the highest number or last in alphabetical order is listed first.
    # Note: For NumericType fields, this method is equivalent to numberdecreasing; for SortType fields, this method is equivalent to reversealphabetical.

    # increasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number or string contained in fieldName. The result with the lowest number or first in alphabetical order is listed first.
    # Note: For NumericType fields, this method is equivalent to numberincreasing; for SortType fields, this method is equivalent to alphabetical.

    # numberdecreasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number contained in fieldName. The result with the highest number is listed first.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a NumericType field.

    # numberincreasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number contained in fieldName. The result with the lowest number is listed first.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a NumericType field.

    # reversealphabetical
    # The display order of results is determined by the string contained in fieldName. Results are displayed in reverse alphabetical order.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a SortType field.

    # SORT OPTIONS
    # Off
    # Results are displayed unsorted.

    # AutnRank
    # Results are displayed in order of the value in their AutnRankType field. The document with the highest AutnRankType field value is listed first.

    # Cluster
    # If you have added Cluster=true to the action, the Cluster sort option allows you to display results in order of cluster (in decreasing cluster ID order).

    # Database
    # Results are displayed in order of database number (in increasing order). The database numbers are defined in IDOL server's configuration file.

    # Date
    # Results are displayed in order of their date (the date contained in the results' DateType fields). The most recent document is listed first. If several documents have the same date, their display order is determined by their autn:docid (document ID) number (the highest autn:docid is listed first).

    # DocIDDecreasing
    # Results aredisplayed in order of their autn:docid (document ID) number. The document with the highest autn:docid is listed first.

    # DocIDIncreasing
    # Results are displayed in order of their autn:docid (document ID) number. The document with the lowest autn:docid is listed first.

    # fieldName:sortMethod
    # Results are sorted according to the value of a specified field. Note that documents in which the specified field is empty are not returned.

    # fieldName
    # Specify the name of the IDOL server field whose value you want to determine the order in which the results are displayed.

    # sortMethod
    # Enter the sorting method that you want to apply to the field fieldName. The following sorting methods are available:

    # alphabetical
    # The display order of results is determined by the string contained in fieldName. Results are displayed in alphabetical order.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a SortType field.

    # decreasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number or string contained in fieldName. The result with the highest number or last in alphabetical order is listed first.
    # Note: For NumericType fields, this method is equivalent to numberdecreasing; for SortType fields, this method is equivalent to reversealphabetical.

    # increasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number or string contained in fieldName. The result with the lowest number or first in alphabetical order is listed first.
    # Note: For NumericType fields, this method is equivalent to numberincreasing; for SortType fields, this method is equivalent to alphabetical.

    # numberdecreasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number contained in fieldName. The result with the highest number is listed first.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a NumericType field.

    # numberincreasing
    # The display order of results is determined by the number contained in fieldName. The result with the lowest number is listed first.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a NumericType field.

    # reversealphabetical
    # The display order of results is determined by the string contained in fieldName. Results are displayed in reverse alphabetical order.
    # Note: IDOL server can perform the sorting process more quickly if fieldName is a SortType field.

    # Random
    # Results are displayed in random order.

    # Relevance
    # Results are displayed in order of their relevance (the document with the highest is listed first). If documents have the same relevance, their display order is determined by their autn:docid (document ID) number (the highest autn:docid is listed first).

    # ReverseDate
    # Results are displayed in order of their date (the date contained in the results' DateType fields). The oldest document is listed first. If several documents have the same date, their display order is determined by their autn:docid (document ID) number (the highest autn:docid is listed first).

    # ReverseRelevance
    # Results are displayed in order of their relevance (the document with the lowest is listed first). If documents have the same relevance, their display order is determined by their autn:docid (document ID) number (the lowest autn:docid is listed first).
